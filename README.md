COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 data using the dataset provided by Our World in Data. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to the pandemic's progression across different countries(USA, Kenya and India) and over time.

Objectives:

Explore and clean the COVID-19 dataset from OWID.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends in cases, deaths, testing, and vaccination.

Visualize key metrics over time and across the three regions.

Generate insights that help contextualize the impact of the pandemic.

Tools and Libraries Used:

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

pandas – for data manipulation and analysis

numpy – for numerical operations

matplotlib – for visualizations

seaborn – for enhanced statistical plots

plotly – for interactive visualizations

datetime – for date operations

Insights and Reflections
Countries that implemented early and strict interventions saw flatter curves in case progression.

Vaccination rollouts significantly correlated with reduced deaths and hospitalizations.

Testing rates varied widely by region, influencing reported case trends.

Stringency index trends often lagged behind case surges, hinting at reactive policy-making.

Data quality and availability inconsistencies posed challenges and were accounted for in analysis.
